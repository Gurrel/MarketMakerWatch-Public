# MarketMakerWatch-Public

A real-time market-microstructure system for tracking market maker inventory and SPX candlestick data.
It uses CBOE VolSummary data to approximate Market makers options book on the SPX index.
The backend continuously streams, aggregates, and serves data to a vanilla HTML, CSS, TypeScript frontend for visualization. 
It does heavy Black and Scholes calculations to simulate Market Maker greeks over different spot prices.

# Here is a demo video showing how it works:
